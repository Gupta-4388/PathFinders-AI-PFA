/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model for the PathFinder AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * Access is granted based on a user-centric, hierarchical data structure. Every authenticated user can
 * create and manage their own data, but they are strictly prohibited from accessing, viewing, or modifying
 * the data of any other user. The default security posture is to deny all access unless explicitly granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data, including resumes, AI mentor feedback, and career dashboards, is organized
 * in subcollections nested under the path `/users/{userId}`. This structure makes ownership clear and
 * allows security rules to leverage the document path for efficient and secure authorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: All data is private. A user can only access documents located within their own
 *   data tree (i.e., where `{userId}` in the path matches their authenticated UID).
 * - No Public Access: There are no globally readable collections.
 * - User Enumeration Disabled: Listing documents from the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to protect user privacy and prevent data scraping.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation or update, rules validate that the internal `userId` or `id` field
 *   matches the `userId` from the document path, ensuring data consistency and immutability.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset leverages path-based authorization. By nesting all data under `/users/{userId}`, the user's
 * ID is part of the path to every document they own. This eliminates the need for costly `get()` calls or
 * denormalizing ownership fields just for security rules, leading to simpler, faster, and more secure logic.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model naturally segregates each user's data into its own document tree. This is the most secure
 * and performant way to manage private user data, as it makes it impossible for queries to accidentally
 * leak data belonging to other users.
